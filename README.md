# MEE6-Grinder-4.0
Random think's he's smart or something

He can't beat automated bots on his server and will never detect them as long as the randomization and intervals are valid.
New features include:
- Clock cycling (will only run when it's x:00 to y:00 to mimic "sleeping")
- Clock randomization (adds minutes and hours to clock cycling every "day" so that you're not always "sleeping" and "waking" up at the same time)
- Better handling for multiple tokens (each token can now have their individual configurations)
- Much more settings to customize (interval, offset, offset variance, interval variance, channel, ...)
- Much easier to change settings (`client._config.{setting}.{subsetting} = x`)
